"Time to Accumulate: The Great Migration and the Rise of the American South" by Dongkyu Yang

The idea that labor scarcity can induce economic development has been long hypothesized at least since Habakkuk (1962), but related evidence is still scarce, especially on non-agricultural development. This paper empirically and quantitatively assesses the role of the Second Great Migration (1940-1970) in the subsequent structural change in the American South between 1970 and 2010. Empirical results using shift-share instruments show that out-migration incentivized physical capital investment and capital-augmenting technical change, increasing capital and output per worker in both agriculture and manufacturing at least until 2010. Labor reallocated from agriculture to non-agriculture. I then develop and calibrate a dynamic spatial equilibrium model that allows substitution between factors of production, factor-biased technical change, and Heckscherâ€“Ohlin forces in trade. The quantitative results indicate that the general equilibrium effects induced by the Second Great Migration could have contributed to 7% of the total decrease in agricultural employment between 1940 and 2010 in the South. The contribution analyses suggest that labor-capital substitution played a leading role, with capital-biased technical change and the quasi-Rybczynski effect playing important supplementary roles.
